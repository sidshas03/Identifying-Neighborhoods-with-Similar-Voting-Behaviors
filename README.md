# Identifying-Neighborhoods-with-Similar-Voting-Behaviors
Analyzed neighborhood-level voting patterns using demographic data (income, race, education). Applied Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Neural Networks to identify areas with similar political behaviors. Used Python for data cleaning, model training, and visualizing correlations across socio-economic factors.
🔍 Objectives
Study the correlation between demographics and political preferences

Classify and cluster neighborhoods with similar voting behavior

Visualize how factors like age, income, and race impact voting trends

Use ML models to improve predictive insights into partisanship

🧠 Models Used
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks

📊 Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
SHAP for feature interpretation
CatBoost and XGBoost
Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization
GeoPandas and Folium for spatial mapping

📌 Key Findings
Republican-leaning neighborhoods tend to have higher proportions of senior or adult populations in certain areas
Young populations are more densely clustered in Democrat-heavy zones, especially in low and medium-income areas
Visual patterns suggest a strong link between partisanship and income distribution
